    <h2>Description of Recipe</h2>
    <p>Jollof Rice is one of the most common one-pot dishes in West Africa. It traditionally consists of jasmine or basmati rice, 
        cooking oil, tomato, onion, curry powder, red pepper, garlic, ginger, and scotch bonnet. The spices used to enhance the flavors are salt,
         ground pepper seasoning such as cayenne, and other herby spices like nutmeg and dried thyme are used. 
        Jollof can be enjoyed as is, but many people will compliment the dish with chicken, beef, fish, or even a salad.Oh just
